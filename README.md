## The Card Project (Personal Project)

After my first six weeks of coding (thanks to DevMountain), I was able to put together my first project. It's a multiplayer card game where players can interact with each other over web sockets.

Uses ReactJs, NodeJs, PostgreSQL, Axios, Auth0, socket.io, Amazon S3, ChartJs, SASS and Stripe.
